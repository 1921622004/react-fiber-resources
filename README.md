# ReactFiber resources [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)

This is for resources for ReactFiber.

ReactFiber is a new React reconciler algorithm, which is in progress.

## React internal algorithm

If you are not familiar with React internals, I recommend you to read the documentations, which are very helpful.

## ReactFiber function call stacks

**[Note]** ReactFiber now behaves as synchlonous by default. See [#8127](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8127).
This call stacks are results in the time when it bahaved as asynclonous.

### ReactDOMFiber

![ReactFiber function call stack](./images/ReactDOMFiber.png)

### ReactDOMFiber with 10000 items

![ReactFiber function call stack with 10000 items](./images/ReactDOMFiber-10000-items.png)

* set `hidden` props 9000 items

```js
var Items = () => (
  $('ul', {},
    items.map(item => $('li', {key: item.index, hidden: item.index > 1000 ? true : false}, item.name))
  )
);
```

### ReactDOM with 10000 items

![ReactDOMFiber function call stack with 10000 items](./images/ReactDOM-10000-items.png)

**It's not fair because ReactDOMFiber hasn't implemented features ReactDOM has yet.**
